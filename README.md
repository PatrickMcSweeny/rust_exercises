In order to learn Rust, I am working my way through the book [Exercises for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers) and posting my solutions here. Feedback welcome.

Each exercise is in its own folder, with the folder number corresponding the to the exercise number in the book.
